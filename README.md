### Prompt

<p>Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.</p>

<p>Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin).</p>

<p>With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.</P>

## Magic Eight Ball
The desired output is that a user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a variable called `userName` that is set to an empty string.
- [ ] Below this variable, create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not. If the user enters a name — like `'Jane'` — use string interpolation to log `Hello, Jane!` to the console. Otherwise, simply log `Hello!`.
- [ ] Create a variable named `userQuestion`. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.
- [ ] Write a `console.log()` for the `userQuestion`, stating what was asked. You can include the user’s name in the `console.log()` statement, if you wish!
- [ ] We need to generate a random number between 0 and 7. Create another variable, and name it `randomNumber`. Set it equal to this expression, which uses two methods `(Math.floor()` and `Math.random())` from the Math library.
- [ ] Create one more variable named `eightBall`, and set it equal to an empty string. We will save a value to this variable in the next steps, depending on the value of `randomNumber`.
